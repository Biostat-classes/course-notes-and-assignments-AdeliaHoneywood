# Another statistics book?

The course focuses on teaching introductory statistics from 
a biological perspective, so examples, papers, and problems focus on natural 
systems when possible.

# Acknowledgements

Many thanks to Bill Rice and Steve Gaines at UCSB for encouraging me to continue
my interests in statistics.  

My department at Baruch also supported me when I  proposed the Biostatistics 
(ENV/BIO 2100) course in 2017 and taught for the 
first time in 2018. 

Baruch College's Center for
Teaching and Learning, as a channel for a  statewide funding effort focuse on 
developed OER (open-educational resources)
at CUNY and SUNY
campuses, have supported the continued development of the class.

The class now includes 

* website (https://sites.google.com/view/biostats/home) housing slides and 
associated material
* tutorials for many lessons using Swirl (https://swirlstats.com/)
    * developed with support of a QUBES working group (https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/teaching_r_fmn)
* this book!
